    Data Preprocessing:
        The text data was preprocessed at the character level, where each character was encoded as a unique integer. This encoding facilitated direct processing of raw text data by the model.
        The dataset was divided into training and validation sets to enable model evaluation and prevent overfitting.

    Model Architecture:
        Your model architecture followed the Transformer framework, a powerful architecture known for its effectiveness in sequence modeling tasks.
        It consisted of embedding layers, including token and positional embeddings, which captured semantic and positional information of tokens in the input sequence, respectively.
        Transformer blocks formed the core of the model, incorporating self-attention mechanisms, feedforward neural networks, and layer normalization. These blocks enabled the model to capture relationships between tokens efficiently and learn complex patterns in the data.
        A language model head, comprising a linear layer followed by a softmax function, was employed to predict the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next token, facilitating text generation.

    Training:
        During training, the model predicted the next token in the sequence, and the cross-entropy loss was computed between the predicted logits and the actual targets.
        The AdamW optimizer was used to update the model parameters, employing weight decay regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

    Text Generation:
        Given a context sequence, the trained model generated text by probabilistically predicting the next token based on its learned representations.
        Sampling was performed iteratively until the desired length of text was achieved, resulting in human-like text resembling the input data.

    Advanced Techniques Utilized:
        Your model integrated advanced techniques such as Transformers, self-attention mechanisms, positional encoding, layer normalization, cross-entropy loss, and the AdamW optimizer.
        These techniques collectively enabled the model to capture long-range dependencies, differentiate between tokens based on their positions, stabilize training, and optimize parameter updates efficiently.
